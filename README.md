# I am Become The Jonan Show

This is a README for 1337807.com, a page that is actually quite dated as I now
go by thejonanshow. 1337807 was actually kind of a terrible handle. Most people
have no idea what 1337 speak is or was and explaining it constantly doesn't seem
to have made a shouted string of numbers any more memorable. I recently decided
to change to 'thejonanshow' because I'm kind of a walking talk show where the
only guest is me. That makes me sound a bit arrogant now that I think of it. I'm
probably not anymore arrogant than most but maybe just give me the benefit of
the doubt until we get a chance to meet.

Anyway this README only exists because someone pointed out to me that the links
on my site were broken (because I changed from 1337807 to thejonanshow) and I
don't remember my root password so I'm changing hosts, as that is the most
logical solution.

I just realized I was actually paying money for a VPS to host this entirely HTML
site that shouldn't exist anymore. Since GitHub has so generously offered to do
it for free I thought I'd move over to GitHub pages.

So now I'm making a GitHub pages site so I can fix the links and dispose of the
VPS I've likely spent several hundreds dollars on over the many months that I've
forgotten it existed.

Here's to stream-of-consciousness README files and being to lazy to reset the
root password. :beer:
